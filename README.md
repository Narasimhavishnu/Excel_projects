# Excel_projects
This repository contains a collection of Excel projects created by me. These projects cover a range of topics and use cases, including financial analysis, data visualization, project management, and more. 
Each project is contained within its own subdirectory, and includes a README file with instructions on how to use and customize the Excel file. Some projects may also include sample data files or additional resources.

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an Excel project you'd like to share, please create a pull request with your project's files and a brief description in the README. If you find a bug or issue with an existing project, please open an issue and we'll work to address it.

We hope this repository serves as a helpful resource for anyone looking to learn more about Excel or seeking inspiration for their own projects.
