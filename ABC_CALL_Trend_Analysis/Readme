ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis

This repository contains a dataset of a Customer Experience (CX) Inbound calling team for 23 days.
The dataset includes various parameters such as Agent_Name, Agent_ID, Queue_Time, Time, Time_Bucket, Duration, Call_Seconds, and call status
(Abandon, answered, transferred).

Business Understanding:
The dataset represents the inbound call volume of the ABC company from the insurance category. 
The objective of the analysis is to determine the average call time duration for all incoming calls received by agents,
show the total volume/number of calls coming in via charts/graphs, and propose a manpower plan to reduce the abandon rate from 30% to 10%.
The analysis will also take into account the incoming calls during the night shift and propose a manpower plan accordingly.

Case Study Objectives:

Calculate the average call time duration for all incoming calls received by agents (in each Time_Bucket).
Show the total volume/number of calls coming in via charts/graphs [Number of calls v/s Time]. You can select time in a bucket form (i.e. 1-2, 2-3, â€¦..)
Propose a manpower plan required during each time bucket [between 9am to 9pm] to reduce the abandon rate to 10%.
Propose a manpower plan required during each time bucket in a day, taking into account the incoming calls during the night shift.
Assumptions:
An agent works for 6 days a week; On average, total unplanned leaves per agent are 4 days a month; An agent's total working hours are 9 Hrs out
